**Introducing the ar.io Console: Enterprise-Ready Tools for the Permanent Web**

Today we're launching the ar.io Console — a complete reimagining of how organizations interact with permanent data storage.

**What is the ar.io Console?**

A unified platform that makes it simple to upload files, deploy decentralized applications, manage payment credits, and secure human-readable ArNS domain names — all from a single dashboard.

**Why we built it**

As more enterprises, institutions, and platforms explore permanent data solutions, we recognized the need for tools that meet their standards: transparent pricing, team-friendly workflows, and direct access to support.

The ar.io Console delivers on that vision with:

- **Flexible payments** — Fiat (credit card) and crypto (10+ tokens including ETH, SOL, USDC, and ARIO)
- **Transparent pricing** — Clear, predictable costs with private pricing available for high-volume needs
- **Team features** — Share and gift credits across your organization
- **Guided onboarding** — Our Builder's Journey walks you from first upload to running your own infrastructure
- **Direct support** — Book a demo with our team for custom implementations

**Who it's for**

- Development teams deploying censorship-resistant applications
- Enterprises requiring permanent, verifiable data archives
- Platforms integrating permanent storage into their products
- Institutions preserving critical records for the long term

The permanent web isn't just for crypto natives anymore. The ar.io Console makes it accessible to everyone.
